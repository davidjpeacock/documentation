= OS Migrate Glossary
:toc:
:toc-placement: preamble

A comprehensive glossary of terms for operators learning about the OS Migrate project.

== Core Concepts

*OS Migrate Collection*::
An Ansible collection (`os_migrate.os_migrate`) that provides modules, roles, and playbooks for migrating OpenStack resources between clouds.

*Resource*::
An OpenStack entity that can be migrated (networks, instances, flavors, images, etc.). Each resource type has its own export/import workflow.

*Export Phase*::
The process of extracting resource definitions from a source OpenStack cloud and serializing them to YAML files.

*Import Phase*::
The process of reading YAML resource files and creating corresponding resources in a destination OpenStack cloud.

*Parallel Migration*::
A modernization strategy where a new OpenStack deployment runs alongside an existing one, with tenant resources migrated between them.

*Idempotent Operations*::
All playbooks can be re-run safely; they won't duplicate resources or cause conflicts.

== Resource Types

*Workloads*::
Running instances/VMs that are migrated from source to destination cloud, including their attached storage and network configuration.

*Detached Volumes*::
Storage volumes not currently attached to any instance.

*Flavors*::
Virtual machine templates that define CPU, memory, and disk specifications.

*Images*::
Disk images used as templates for creating instances.

*Networks*::
Virtual networks that provide connectivity between instances.

*Subnets*::
IP address ranges within networks that define available IP addresses.

*Routers*::
Virtual routers that provide connectivity between networks and external networks.

*Router Interfaces*::
Connections between routers and subnets.

*Security Groups*::
Firewall rule sets that control network traffic to instances.

*Security Group Rules*::
Individual firewall rules within security groups.

*Projects*::
OpenStack tenants that contain and isolate resources.

*Users*::
OpenStack user accounts with authentication credentials.

*Keypairs*::
SSH key pairs used for secure instance access.

*User Project Role Assignments*::
Mappings that grant users specific roles within projects.

== Migration Infrastructure

*Conversion Host*::
A temporary VM created in the destination cloud to facilitate workload migration, particularly for disk image transfer.

*Conversion Host Content*::
Software and configuration deployed on conversion hosts to enable migration functionality.

*Migrator Host*::
The system where OS Migrate playbooks are executed, coordinating the migration process.

== Data Management

*Data Directory* (`os_migrate_data_dir`)::
Local filesystem location where exported YAML resource files are stored during migration.

*Resource Filter* (`os_migrate_<resource>_filter`)::
Name-based filtering to selectively export/import specific resources rather than all resources of a type.

*Serialization*::
The process of converting OpenStack SDK objects into OS Migrate's standardized YAML format.

*Resource Validation*::
Checking that imported YAML files contain valid resource definitions before attempting import.

*File Validation* (`import_<resource>_validate_file`)::
Optional validation step that verifies resource data integrity before import operations.

== Resource Structure

*params_from_sdk*::
Resource properties that are copied to the destination cloud (configuration, settings).

*info_from_sdk*::
Resource properties that are NOT copied (UUIDs, timestamps, read-only data).

*Migration Parameters*::
OS Migrate-specific settings that control migration behavior for each resource.

*SDK Parameters*::
Parameters used when making OpenStack API calls to create or update resources.

*Readonly SDK Parameters*::
Parameters that are allowed during resource creation but not during updates.

== Authentication & Configuration

*Source Auth* (`os_migrate_src_auth`)::
OpenStack authentication credentials for the source cloud.

*Destination Auth* (`os_migrate_dst_auth`)::
OpenStack authentication credentials for the destination cloud.

*clouds.yaml*::
OpenStack client configuration file containing cloud authentication details.

*Source Cloud* (`SRC_CLOUD`)::
Environment variable identifying the source cloud configuration in clouds.yaml.

*Destination Cloud* (`DST_CLOUD`)::
Environment variable identifying the destination cloud configuration in clouds.yaml.

== Ansible Components

*Export Roles*::
Ansible roles that call export modules and handle resource filtering (e.g., `export_networks`, `export_workloads`).

*Import Roles*::
Ansible roles that validate data files and call import modules (e.g., `import_networks`, `import_workloads`).

*Export Modules*::
Ansible modules that retrieve resources from source cloud and serialize to YAML (e.g., `export_flavor.py`).

*Import Modules*::
Ansible modules that read YAML files and create resources in destination cloud (e.g., `import_flavor.py`).

*Prelude Roles*::
Setup roles that prepare the environment:
- `prelude_src` - Source cloud preparation
- `prelude_dst` - Destination cloud preparation  
- `prelude_common` - Common setup tasks

*Resource Class*::
Python class that defines how OpenStack SDK objects are converted to/from OS Migrate format. All inherit from the base `Resource` class.

== Development & Testing

*Role Skeleton*::
Template structure for creating new export/import roles using the role-addition script.

*Unit Tests*::
Tests that verify module logic and resource class behavior in isolation.

*Functional Tests*::
Tests that verify roles and modules work correctly in integration scenarios.

*End-to-End Tests* (E2E)::
Full migration workflow tests that validate complete export/import cycles.

*Sanity Tests*::
Ansible collection sanity checks that verify code quality and standards compliance.

== Container Environment

*Container Engine*::
Configurable container runtime (Podman/Docker) used for development environment via `CONTAINER_ENGINE` variable.

*Development Container*::
CentOS Stream 10 container with Python 3.12 where all OS Migrate commands execute.

*Source Mount*::
The `/code` directory inside the container where the OS Migrate source code is mounted.

== Build & Deployment

*Collection Build*::
Process of packaging OS Migrate into an Ansible collection archive for distribution.

*Galaxy Installation*::
Installing the OS Migrate collection via `ansible-galaxy collection install os_migrate.os_migrate`.

*Dependencies*::
Required Ansible collections (`community.crypto`, `community.general`, `openstack.cloud`) and Python packages.

== Migration Process

*Three-Phase Migration*::
The standard workflow: Export → Transfer → Import.

*Transfer Phase*::
Moving exported YAML data files from source environment to destination environment.

*Validation Phase*::
Verifying that resources were created correctly and handling any migration errors.

*Resource References*::
Cross-references between resources (e.g., instances referencing networks) that must be resolved during import.
